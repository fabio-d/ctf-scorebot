BIG WARNING!!!
This scorebot has been modified to generate shorter flags than the one I've
forked from:
  https://github.com/RootFu/ctf-scorebot

It has only been tested on the mafia2007 image available at
  http://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/ictfdata/2007/vms/mafia2007.tar.gz

Note that the following modification to the mafia2007 image is required for the
snitch service to be detected properly:
 1) Login as "amends" (passowrd: "amends")
 2) Open /home/amends/php-include/filter.php
 3) Go the the filter_ccnum function (near the end of file)
 4) Replace the following line
        preg_match('/^[A-Za-z0-9=+\/]{1,40}$/', $ccnum)) {
    with
        preg_match('/^[A-Za-z0-9=_\-]{1,40}$/', $ccnum)) {

---------------------------------------------------------------

To start a simple CTF game, run:

python2 StandardCTF.py -i -c <config_file>

The -i argument initializes a new game. Foregoing the -i will cause the game to attempt to restore from the previous game.
