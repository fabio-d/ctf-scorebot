BIG WARNING!!!
This scorebot generates shorter flags than the one I've forked from:
  https://github.com/RootFu/ctf-scorebot

It has only been tested on the mafia2007 image available at
  http://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/ictfdata/2007/vms/mafia2007.tar.gz

---------------------------------------------------------------

To start a simple CTF game, run:

python2 StandardCTF.py -i -c <config_file>

The -i argument initializes a new game. Foregoing the -i will cause the game to attempt to restore from the previous game.
